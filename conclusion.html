      <h1><b><u>Conclusions From This Research</u></b></h1><br><br>
      <p>We have only looked at the impact living in a town or a village has on
        the students and ultimately wanted to see if any students were at an
        advantage due to this. From the plots we have produced there is nothing
        to suggest that either of these demographics are benefitting over the
        other.
      </p><br><br>
        <p>However, this is not a well-balanced dataset as we have more than
         twice as many students from villages than towns.
         We would benefit from gathering some more data for students from towns
         to bring this closer to the total of students we have from villages.
         This should then give us a truer understanding of how the two are in
         comparison. Some further questions that I would also like to answer
         from this dataset are; how does family income affect the students
         performance; how does the family income relate to the school type the
         student attends and how are students from the different school types
         performing?</p><br><br>
         <p>Privacy concerns for this data set were ensuring the anonymity of
           the students, for this we havenâ€™t collected any data that could be
           easily traced to an individual. This has been achieved as we are not
           aware of any names or locations of the students. It is also important
           to ensure that this data is not used for unfair profiling or
           discrimination.</p>
