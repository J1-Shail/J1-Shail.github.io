        <h3><u>Language Distribution for Town and Village</u></h3><br>
          <p>The distribution of languages for Towns and Villages are being
          displayed in figure 2.1. To get a truer understanding of this
          distribution the next step would be to plot these as percentages of
          the Towns and Villages rather than raw data. However, we can see a
          trend in that Towns have more English speakers than any other language
          and in Villages Asm was the most common. We can also see that these
          two languages are the most widely used for both locations.</p>

        <h3><u>School Type Distribution for Town and Village</u></h3><br>
          <p>Figure 2.2 has also been grouped by Town and Village to discover
          the distribution of school types. Again, this could benefit from
          being displayed as percentages to give better comparison between the
          two than just the raw data. We are still able to see from the graph
          that Government schools are the highest attended by both students
          from Towns and students from Villages but a higher percentage of
          the students from towns attend private schools - not to be confused
          with raw number of students as overall more students from villages
          attend private schools. This is due to having more students from
          villages present in this dataset.</p>

      <h3><u>Family Income Distribution</u></h3><br>
        <p>Figure 2.3 is a bar plot of family's monthly incomes grouped by town
        or village. It shows very few incomes in the very high bracket with many
        of the families belonging to the medium income bracket. We can also see
        the same trends of family incomes for both locations.</p>

    <h3><u>Final Exam Performance for Town and Village Students</u></h3><br>
      <p>Figure 2.4 has the students grouped by town or village again, this
      time looking at how they performed in their final exams. We could see
      similar trends in that the result most seen for both demographics was a
      good score followed by very good. It would also be worthwhile to convert
      these results into percentages per town and village to get a better
      understanding of how each result is distributed. </p>

    <h3><u>How does Travel Time influence Class Attendance</u></h3><br>
      <p>For figure 2.5 we produced a graph whereby the bars have been grouped by
        travel time and the individual bars represent the class attendance.
        This shows us that many of students have a small travel time. Students
        with small and average travel times both see the same trend of good,
        average then poor attendance from highest to lowest whereas those with
        a large travel time being average, good and then poor. A prescriptive
        solution to try to influence those travelling furthest to up their
        attendance records could be to closely monitor attendance in general
        and act if any issues arise. There are multiple avenues that a college
        could go down for this, but one option may be to push the agenda on how
        important attendance is for good results - something that we should be
        able to create proof of from the dataset.</p>

    <h3><u>What affect do Study Hours have on Final Exam Performance?</u></h3><br>
      <p>We have produced another grouped bar chart for this with the bars being
        grouped by study hours and each bar representing the final exam
        performance. We can see that for those students whose study hours were
        considered poor none of them achieved the best grade and for those whose
        study time was good everyone achieved higher than a pass. We could then
        start to consider why this may be the case. One prescriptive solution
        for encouraging students to understand the importance of studying could
        be to make these research findings available to them to hope that it
        makes the students aware on the benefits of putting the time in.
        It could also be useful to speak to some students personally to find
        what is holding them back in terms of studying and finding how best to
        support those students.</p>
